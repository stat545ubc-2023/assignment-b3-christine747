# Palmer Penguins App

[Link to run the app](https://christinec.shinyapps.io/palmerpenguinsapp/) 

## Overview

The Palmer Penguin App can be used as an exploratory tool or for research purposes that involve looking at penguins that live on the islands Biscoe, Dream, and Torgensen within the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica between the years 2007 to 2009. The penguin species include Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Users can view results based on selected species, islands, various ranges for bill depth, and flipper length. It also helps visualize the data in a histogram corresponding to the body mass of the penguins. Users can also interact with the results table below the graph. 

### App Features

1. **Bill depth and Flipper length range selection**: Users can select the desired range for penguin bill depth and flipper length measured in mm.

2. **Species selection**: Users can select to view measurement results of their desired penguin species. 

3. **Island selection**: Users have the option to filter results by islands or have a broad overview by selecting the "all islands" option.

4. **Interactive results table**: At the bottom of the graph, there is an interactive table that shows the all the results including more information on each individual penguin. 


## Data Source
